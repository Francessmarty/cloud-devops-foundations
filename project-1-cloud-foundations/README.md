# Project 1: Cloud Foundations

## Overview
This project demonstrates foundational cloud resource management using Microsoft Azure concepts and CLI-based scripting.  
The focus is on understanding how cloud resources specifically resource groups are structured, named, created and cleaned up using automation-friendly Bash scripts.

Due to account access limitations, this project is implemented as a **deployment simulation**, reflecting real-world planning, scripting, and operational readiness rather than live resource creation.



## Goal
The goal of this project is to build a strong understanding of core cloud computing concepts, service models and deployment models before progressing to more advanced infrastructure automation and DevOps workflows.



## Key Concepts Covered

### Cloud Computing Fundamentals
- On demand resource provisioning
- Scalability and elasticity
- Pay-as-you-go cost models
- Infrastructure abstraction

### Cloud Service Models
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Virtual machines, networks, and storage managed by the user
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Application platforms managed by the provider
- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Fully managed software delivered to end users

### Deployment Models
- **Public Cloud:** Shared provider infrastructure
- **Private Cloud:** Dedicated infrastructure
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public and private environments

### High Availability & Disaster Recovery
- Resource redundancy
- Fault tolerance
- Backup and recovery planning
- Regional and zonal awareness

## Diagrams

This project includes the following high level diagrams to illustrate core cloud concepts:
	•	Cloud Disaster Recovery Architecture  Demonstrates a cloud based disaster recovery setup with primary and backup regions, automated backups, and failover considerations.
	•	Cloud Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)  Visual comparison of responsibility and abstraction layers across infrastructure, platform, and software service models.
	•	Cloud Deployment Models (Public, Private, Hybrid)  Illustrates differences in infrastructure ownership, access control, scalability, and security across deployment models.
  
## Outcome

By completing this project, I developed a solid understanding of foundational cloud computing concepts and how cloud resources are planned, structured and managed using automation-first principles. This project prepares me for hands-on infrastructure provisioning and more advanced DevOps workflows.
