# Project 2: Resource Group and Deployment Simulations

## Overview
This project demonstrates an automation ready Bash script that simulates creating an Azure Resource Group using Azure CLI commands.

Due to Azure account registration limitations, the deployment is documented as a simulation, focusing on correct command structure, logging and operational readiness.

## What this project includes
- Bash script to define variables and simulate Azure CLI deployment steps
- Clear log output to show the intended workflow
- Optional cleanup step (delete resource group) included but commented out
- Screenshot evidence from terminal execution

## Files
- `scripts/create_rg-ops-foundation.sh` script for resource group creation (simulation)
- `screenshots/` terminal screenshot evidence
