# ## Overview

This project demonstrates foundational cloud resource management using Azure concepts and CLI based scripting. The focus is on understanding how resource groups are structured, named, created, and cleaned up using automation-friendly Bash scripts.

Due to account access limitations, this project is documented as a deployment simulation, which reflects real-world planning, scripting, and operational readiness.
